# Predicting-Survival-chances-in-stroke-patients
Predicting Survival chances in stroke patients above 80 - The International Stroke Trial (IST) was one the biggest randomised trials in acute stroke. Methods: Available data on variables assessed at randomisation, at the early outcome point (14-days after randomisation or prior discharge) and at 6-months were extracted and made publically available. This data was collected over six years from 1991 to 1996. However the pilot phase was from 1991 to 1993. We will not be considering pilot phase since during that phase most of the variables were unavailable.
